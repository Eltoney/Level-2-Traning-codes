# The ":" in front of the variable name is just a type hint. it doesn't actually enforce the type!
# I personally use it to keep track of the different types of variables in my code. Makes it cleaner.
# It's optional. Don't use it if you don't want to.

firstName : str = input()
secondName : str = input()
